            <p id="bold">Website</p>
            Built a sport related website. As a sports enthusiast myself I wanted a page on which I could get
            information
            about all main sports. So, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.Vue I built a webpage.
            <p id="bold">Bank Program</p>
            Built a console program called bank. It is C# oriented. It is a console application. I just wanted to see
            what I
            can make using the knowledge that I have as a studying student. This program lets you transfer, withdraw,
            and
            even deposit amounts in your account. It also uses inheritance.
            I would be willing to show you these projects if you are interested.
